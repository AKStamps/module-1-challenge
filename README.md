# Module 1 Challenge for UNC Chapel hill Coding Boot Camp

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to refactor existing code within a website for Horiseon Social Solution Services to meet accessibility standards and optimize site for search engines, this goal will be met with the following criteria.
<ul>
  <li>
  Use semantic HTML elements and remove any non semantic elements from code
  </li>
  <li>
  Add a descriptive title for the webstite
  </li>
  <li>
  Add proper ALT tages for all images
  </li>
  <li>
  Add proper indentation within HTML to clean up code
  </li>
</ul>

## Project Purpose
<p>
  The purpose and motivation for this project is to better understand and develop skills in the use and application of semantic HTML elements and website accessibility standards.
  In the time working on this project I have gained knowledge in the uses of semantic HTMl and image ALT tags for their applications with programs like screen readers for the visually impaired. I have also come to a better understanding of how semantic structuring of a website allows not only a better organized code but the ability for such programs to properly browse a site.  I have also learned alot about the uses and application of a README file in the professional workplace.

#### Conclusions

<section>
  <p>
      As you can see from the screenshots the HTML file uses very few semantic selectors which would not allow it to pass accessibility standards.
    The website also does not have a descriptive name in the header and has disorganized class and ID selectors which become more apparent in the CSS file.
    The images in the HTML file also do not have any ALT tages which will not allow them to be read by a screen reader.
  </p>
  <p>
     The CSS file, although fully functional, is very disorganized and difficult to navigate due to a classes not being in sequential order with the webpage
    and several confusing class names.  The following screenshots demonstrate the refactored code.

### Refactored Code Screenshots

<figure>
  <figcaption>This screenshot shows the refactored HTML code within the head and header sections of the webpage.  Within the head the meta tag "viewport" has been added to adjust the page to fit different device screens and a descriptive title has been added for the webpage.  Within the header semantic elements have been added to accessibility as well as a note infoming anyone viewing the code that it is the header and navigation links section of code.</figcaption>
