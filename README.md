### Project Purpose
<p>
  The purpose and motivation for this project is to better understand and develop skills in the use and application of semantic HTML elements and website accessibility standards.
  In the time working on this project I have gained knowledge in the uses of semantic HTMl and image ALT tags for their applications with programs like screen readers for the visually impaired. I have also come to a better understanding of how semantic structuring of a website allows not only a better organized code but the ability for such programs to properly browse a site.  I have also learned alot about the uses and application of a README file in the professional workplace.
